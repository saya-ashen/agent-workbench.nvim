# Changelog

## 2026-07-24

- **CHANGED:** Replace box-drawing tool block borders with fold indicators (`▾`/`▸`) and indentation for a cleaner, less noisy layout.
- **CHANGED:** Successful tool calls now end silently; only errors show a status footer.
- **ADDED:** Animated spinner on running tool header rows (`PiToolRunning` highlight).

- **CHANGED:** `pi.toggle_history_blocks()` now also toggles thinking blocks.

## 2026-07-08

## 2026-06-18
